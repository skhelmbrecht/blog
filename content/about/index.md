My name is Sarah Helmbrecht, and I am a third-year student at Tulane University. I am graduating a year early this May with a B.S. in Mathematics and Computer Science. In the fall of 2023, I will be attending New York University for my M.S. in Mathematics.  

I am interning in the quantitative finance industry this summer. I am interested in a career in machine learning, data science, or quantitative finance.  

My personal interests include cooking, baking, guitar, piano, and songwriting.
